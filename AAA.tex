%Algemeen Conjunctuurenquêtes


%Sinds 1954 houdt de Nationale Bank bij een panel van ongeveer 3000 bedrijfsleiders een maandelijkse enquête naar hun appreciatie van de economische toestand. De resultaten worden rond de 21e van elke maand gepubliceerd en bevatten naast globale indicatoren tevens resultaten per bedrijfstak. Deelnemers aan de enquête ontvangen bovendien nog resultaten per product. Conjunctuurenquêtes leveren waardevolle informatie over het economisch verloop vóór de traditionele statistieken beschikbaar komen. Hun waarde wordt verhoogd door de internationale vergelijkbaarheid.

%Op verzoek van de beroepsorganisaties van de Belgische ondernemingen, heeft de Nationale Bank in 1954 maandelijkse enquêtes naar het ondernemersvertrouwen opgezet. Deze enquêtes, die zijn ontstaan in de Verenigde Staten in de jaren dertig en die in 1949 werden geïntroduceerd in Europa (in Duitsland), hebben tot doel de mening van de ondernemers omtrent het economische conjunctuurklimaat en omtrent de op de korte termijn te verwachten ontwikkelingen, nauwkeurig en snel in te zamelen. Zij vormen een uiterst waardevol instrument met het oog op de conjunctuuranalyse, omdat hun resultaten - die beschikbaar zijn voor de lopende maand - veel vroeger beschikbaar zijn dan de informatie van de kwantitatieve indicatoren.

%De conjunctuurenquêtes die bij de ondernemers worden uitgevoerd, vormen het voorwerp van een harmonisatieprogramma van de Europese Commissie. Dankzij dit programma zijn de gehanteerde methoden en de verkregen resultaten in de diverse Europese landen geheel en al vergelijkbaar.

%De maandelijkse resultaten van de conjunctuurenquêtes worden verspreid en becommentarieerd in een beknopt perscommuniqué, tussen de 21e en de 25e van elke maand. De precieze datum wordt aangekondigd in een kalender die kan worden geraadpleegd op de internetsite.

%De industriële ondernemingen worden daarnaast ook één keer per kwartaal bevraagd omtrent de benuttingsgraad van het productievermogen, en één keer om de zes maanden omtrent de investeringen. De resultaten van de enquête naar de benuttingsgraad van het productievermogen worden opgenomen in het maandelijkse perscommuniqué, terwijl die van de enquête naar de investeringen het voorwerp uitmaken van een speciaal communiqué.


\chapter{The Business Survey Indicator}

This first chapter is a presentation of the Belgian business survey and the business survey indicator, also referred to as the business survey barometer or business confidence barometer/indicator.
We will first go thought the evolution of the barometer since it started. Then present the recruitment method, the objectives and methodology of they survey. 
In the last part of the chapter, we will present the calculation method of the business survey indicator (BSI).

\section{History}

The Belgian Business Survey celebrates this year it's 65\textsuperscript{th} anniversary, since the Survey was launched by the National Bank of Belgium in 1954. 
Belgium was part of the pioneers since only the United States (1930) and West Germany (1949) had a business survey.

In 1972, the results where first synthesised in an indicator.
The Business Survey Barometer started by including only the industrial sector. It was then small by small enlarged to other sectors: construction, trade and services. % (1970 - 1994)

At the European level, it was in 1961 that the European Commission launched an harmonisation program of the Business Survey in the manufacturing industry. 
Since then, the sector coverage of the programme has widened considerably. The Business Survey programme was extended to the construction sector and the investment plans in the manufacturing sector in 1966, to consumers in 1972, to the retail trade in 1984, and to the services sector in 1996.
The harmonisation only concerns the type of questions, the possible answers and the method to calculate the indicator. ...
More information ca be found in the "The Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys User Guide" \cite{european_commission_joint_2016}.

Over the time, the business survey barometer has been well known for been a very informative and useful indicator. 
It was noticed in a paper by the Wall Street Journal titled \textit{"Euroland Discovers A Surprise Indicator: Belgian Confidence"} \citep{rhoads_euroland_1999} that acknowledged its importance and accuracy in understanding the evolution of the Belgian economy.

% For example in 1999 an article was published in the Wall Street Journal titled \textit{"Euroland Discovers A Surprise Indicator: Belgian Confidence"} \citep{rhoads_euroland_1999} that noted the accuracy of its predictions.

Due to the structure of Belgian economy ... it was also shown as been a good predictor for the European economy \cite{vanhaelen_belgian_2000}

Today, Nowcasting is a well studied subject and very important for public and private organisation to have an as clear as possible view of the state of the economy.

Several improvement of the business survey where proposed and applied over time (1983, 1990 and 2009). The last ?improvements will be discussed in detail in \autoref{section:Methodology}.


\section{Sampling Method}
\label{sec:Recruitment of participants}

The Belgian business survey barometer (as most of the business survey around the world), has the particularity of not using random sampling.
The selection of participants is quite complex and a lot of decision are human, never is a statistical program or a random sampling system used to select new participants.

\subsubsection{Procedure of selection}

% Without going to much into details. 
The selections of new participants is done by "waves". When the department responsible for the business survey at the NBB decides that there aren't enough participants in a specific sector anymore, the recruitment of new participants is launched. 

To find the new participants, the first step is to decided for an optimal amount of new participants needed, regarding the different stratification of the sector.
Each sector is composed of a quite advanced trees of sub-sectors, sub-sub-sectors, ... . for example the industry sector is divided into more than 300 sub-sectors / branches over 6 different levels. A representation of the classification ca be seen in \autoref{fig:tree}.

% When a new recruitment procedure is started, it's looked at those branches to see, based on there importance in Belgian economy, which could take advantage of having more respondents. For example, if a certain sub-sector represents 1 \% of Belgian GDP but its respondents only present 0.1 \% of the respondents of the survey. It will be decided to look for more respondents for this sub-sector. This is a very simplified version of how this is done since there is also the size of the company that has to be taken into account, next to the size of the sub-sector. Therefore this procedure is quite complex and contains a lot human decisions.

As will be seen in \autoref{sec:Weighting procedure} and \autoref{sec:Globalisation procedure} more in details, companies are weighted by there size (profit, number of employees, ...) and the size of the sector/branch they are part of. 
Based on those information, it's looked at which branches, size of companies, new respondents should be looked for. 
This makes the procedure quite complex and therefore contains a lot of human decisions.
 
Out of this process comes a list of potential new participants. This list is then send to the communication department that takes  contact with those potential new participants. 
Not always, but it happens quite often, a representative of the National Bank visits the new participant to explain the survey and have a contact.
As a reward for participating at the survey, the companies receive privileged information. Each month they receive access to sub-sector indicators information that aren't publicly distributed. This can give them economical information regarding there specific economical activity.

At the National Bank of Belgium, this procedure is usually referred to as "prospecting" rather than selecting or sampling. Since it is mostly based on recruiting new companies that will work with them, by looking at the Belgian economy and find participants willing to collaborate. For example, it's possible that the responsible person for the Horeca business survey, goes to  restaurant et get acquainted with the owner, sees the interest of including him in the business survey and recruits him this way. This is a less common way, the main of the recruitment happens to the process explained above.


\subsubsection{Leaving the Survey}

An important side of business survey is that people are staying as long as possible in the survey.
Ones  companies are part of the survey, they stay in it until they decide to leave. There are no participants removed from the survey by the national Bank, what can happen is that if participants don't answer for three months, contact will be taken with the company to see if they want to continue to participate.

There is a real work done by the National Bank to make sure companies answer to the survey, and stay in the survey.
This means that some companies are part of the survey for a very long time.
To have an idea, if we look at the Survey for the Industry, trace respondents back to 1988, we can see that today, approximately one third of the respondents where already in the survey in 1988. 

\subsubsection{Why not a problem that Random Sampling isn't used}

% The National Bank of Belgium is using random or stratified sampling for other survey. So why isn't it the case here ?

From a statistical point of view, it can be rather problematic to draw general conclusions over a populations when Random Sampling is not use.
Without undermining one of the most important pillars of statistics, there are two main reasons why in this case, having a non-random selection of participants is not too problematic.

The first reason is that the method used tries to represent as good as possible the population that it wants to represent. Therefore stratification is used at a quite advanced level as explained before. 
We could call this recruitment method: non-random stratification, as opposed to random stratification. Since it's not using sampling but takes into account the stratification of the population it's studying.

The second reason ,the most import one, is that the business survey Indicator has no interest on its own. Indeed having a BSI equal to 0.5 or 0.1 don't mean anything, what's important is the evolution of the indicator. If it was equal to 0.3 last month and this month it's equal to 0.5, it means that the economy is most probably growing and that we can forecast an increase of GDP over the month. On the other hand if it's now equal to 0.1, it means a decrease in economical confidence among businesses and we can anticipate a deceleration/decrease of GDP over that period.

% This means that people participate for a long time to the survey will be discussed in chapter .... and ....


\section{Objectives of the Business Survey}
\label{section:Objective}

\subsubsection{predictive power for the future months - high correlation with Economical Indicators}

The main objective of the business survey Barometer is to have a feeling of how the economy is now and how it will evolve in the short term. Therefore we will first speak about nowcasting, its explanation and its implications.


average weekly work hours in manufacturing, factory orders for goods, housing permits and stock prices
 index of consumer expectations, average weekly claims for unemployment insurance and the interest rate
 

\subsubsection{fluctuation that's mostly explained by the conjuncture}
The second objective of the Business Confidence Barometer, is to make prevision as less as possible influenced by short terms variation, but the capture the more long run evolution of the economy, more precisely, business cycles. Therefor we will here discuss business cycles.

In \autoref{chap:nonresponse dropout}, we will discuss most of the small, short-term variation that can influence the BSI and that aren't relevant. Those can be due to the responses to the survey (non- response, dropout and Attrition) but also to "real" effects (seasonal effects) that shouldn't be captured by the BSI.

\subsection{Belgian economy and sector specific short term evolution}

%This will be less prominent in this paper, but is important to mention, each month a quite long report is done based on the BSI for each sector and sub-sector.

The business survey indicators are published at the end of each month (around the 21-25 of the month) and give a fast capture of the evolution of the Belgian economy over the past months.
The data is available on \href{http://stat.nbb.be/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=BUSSURVM&Lang=en}{stat.nbb.be} and a press release is published on \href{http://www.nbb.be/doc/dq/e/conj.htm}{nbb.be}. 
It contains a short summary and interpretation of the BSI followed by graphs to show the evolution of the BSI over the two last years for the sector specific and overall indicator.
The public can use those information to have a snapshot of the economy, while other indicators, as GDP or unemployment, can take a very long time before been obtained and published.


\subsection{Nowcasting}

Also called "flash" estimation, nowcasting has increasingly gain importance in the last decade (see \cite{foroni_comparison_2014}, \cite{de_antonio_liedo_nowcasting_2014}, ...).
it consists in the short term estimation of the economy, mostly the GDP.
It is a fundamental approach since the business survey indicator is published monthly while other indicator's like GDP are published quarterly.

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:timeline}, 
the lag between the observation and publication is even greater since the business survey Indicator is published at the end of each month (around the 24-25\textsuperscript{th} of each month, will the GDP is published with a lag of 3-4 weeks ????

    \caption{Timeline of the publication of the business survey Indicator (BSI) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)}
    \label{fig:timeline}
\end{figure}

Nowcasting got by the time a catch all word and include predictive models going from Linear models to space-space models and also including ARIMA or MIDAS and much more different models.



\subsection{Business Cycles}
\label{sec:Business Cycles}

Before going further, a small summary of business cycle theory. 

As already said, an important role of the business survey Indicator, is to identify business cycles.


The domain is very wide and a lot of books and articles where published about the subject. 

Already in 1946, \citeauthor{mitchell_measuring_1946} published the book "\textit{Measuring Business Cycles}". They 
Business cycles where described as recursive fluctuations, affecting macroeconomics variables.

Business cycles are putting aside other effects like seasonal variation and other small variations. It is taking into account a larger trend in the economy.

\subsubsection{What's GDP and Year on Year GDP}

As seen, business cycles are defined by several macroeconomic variables. 
Gross domestic income (GDI), unemployment, ...

But the main indicator, is the GDP

Later on we will also use YoY GDP, for x reasons

\begin{eqnarray}
   \mbox{YoY GDP} = \frac{\mbox{GDP}_t - \mbox{GDP}_{t-12}}{\mbox{GDP}_{t-12}} 
\end{eqnarray}

\autoref{fig:Business Cycle} shows a simplified version of the Business Cycles theory.

\subsubsection{Duration of a Business Cycle}

\autoref{fig:Business Cycle} can give the false impression that business cycles are of the same length, this is, in real life, not so simple.

\cite{mitchell_measuring_1946} stated a minimum duration of 16-22 months and a maximum duration of 100-106 months. This is a quite large range and since then several researches worked on this topic. There is no clear 

As a lot of research argues, business cycles are mainly empirically defined. 
If we look for example at the United States, a big work was done by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to date turning points for the American economy. The empirical evidence that comes out of this work, is that the time from one economic peak to the next is on average 5 and a halve years (for the period 1945-2009)

We can see from \autoref{fig:NBER BS}, which represent the different though and peak of business cycles identified by the NBER from 1975 to 2009, that their is no symmetry of the Business Cycle. Some business cycles are very short while other last more than ten years.
We can notice that periods of economical growth, usually last longer than economical decrease. ....

\section{Methodology of the Business Survey}
\label{section:Methodology}

1954 begin
1972 results are synthesised in an indicator
1983 \& 1990 methodological changes

The latest large improvement of the business survey Indicator happened in 2009 which was explained in a working paper titled \textit{"The National Bank of Belgium’s new business survey indicator"} 
(\citeauthor{de_greef_national_2009})

- only take a limited amount of questions into account, the most relevant ones (3-4 questions) \\
- inclusion of the services in the global indicator \\
- lighten smoothing method

% Qualitative information



\subsection{Questionnaire}
\label{sec:Questionnaire}

The questionnaire exists in two languages, french and dutch. And can be answered by mail, email, over the phone or by fax.

The questionnaire has XX questions that can be grouped in two type of questions. 
(1) questions concerning there current production and level of activity.
(2) questions concerning there prediction, how they expect there level of activity to evolve over the next three months.
It's therefore that the business survey indicator, is also called the confidence indicator, since its a measure of how confidence companies are in the Belgian economy.


\subsubsection{Changes over time}

In this paper, the answers and results of the business survey barometer will be used since 1988. Therefore it's very important to see if the answers changed over time.

A questionnaire from 1990 was found (See Appendix \autopageref{Questionnaire1990}) and can be compared to a more recent version (See Appendix \autopageref{Questionnaire2018}).

It can be seen that the layout was modified, and that the questions phrasing changed over this long period. It was before asked in the first person while it's now phrased in the third person. Aside from those small changes, the survey kept the same questions

It would be interesting to have a closer look in the potential consequences of those changes over time. The layout, the phrasing and the method of answering can potentially have an influence on the answers. Nevertheless, since it's not the subject of this paper, we will leave this study to future research.
What we  can say is that the influence of those changes are limited since the respondents where mostly the same when the changes happened, so the interpretation they made from 
one version to the other one should have stayed quite similar.

\subsubsection{Questions taken into account for the NS975}


The first question has to be interpreted the opposite way as of the three other questions. ...

\subsection{Weighting procedure}
\label{sec:Weighting procedure}

Each company that is part of the panel of respondents, has a weight according to it's size, the profit the company is making, the capital it's owning and other characteristics. The calculation is quite complex since it's specific to each sector. For example in the industry the ...

According to the size of the company, measured different ways depending on the sector ........

Adapted over time, with a smoothing effect over time

\subsection{Globalisation procedure}
\label{sec:Globalisation procedure}


Based on the size of the sector in which the company is.

The National Bank of Belgium developed a quite elaborate division of the Belgian economical activity. This means that for example, the Industry is subdivided into different sub-sectors, that them self contain sub-sectors that contain sub-sectors and so on six times. All those divisions have a percentage according to the size of those subdivision inside the division.

%The globalisation procedure got quite complex over time. See the globalisation tree for the Industry survey \autopageref{fig:tree}

\section{Calculation of the Indicator}

This section presents the method for calculating the business survey indicator. 
The calculation in itself is standard, but the different ways to write it are important for interpretation and to better understand the following chapters. 
We first present the calculation taking into account one question  unweighted and then weighted. 
After we will present how the indicator of different questions are combined together.


\subsection{Unweighted Indicator}

The calculation of the unweighted indicator for a specific question at a specific time is the mean of the responses and can be written as follow;

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
\end{equation} 

where 
$x_i$ is the answer of the respondent $i$ and can take value $-1$ (negative answer), $0$ (neutral answer) and $1$ (positive answer). 
$n$ is the number of respondents.

Since $x_i$ can only take three different values, we can decompose it into 

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{0i} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n_+} x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^{n_0} x_{0i} + \sum_{i=1}^{n_-} x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 


where 
$x_{+i}$, $x_{Ni}$ and $x_{-i}$ are the positive (+), neutral (N) and negative (-) answers of the respondent $i$.

Since we know that $\sum_{i=1}^n x_{0i} = 0$, we can write

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}}{n}  + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 

${\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}}/{n}$ is the proportion of positive answers and ${\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}/{n}$ is the negative proportion of negative answer. We can write, for simplicity

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \pi_+ - \pi_-  \label{eq: BSI Unweighted}
\end{equation}

where $\pi_+$ and $\pi_-$ are the proportion of respondents answering positive and negative to the specific question.
$\pi$ was chosen as symbol here,  since it can be interpreted as a probability: if we assume that all the respondents have the same probability giving a certain answer, $\pi$ is the probability that a respondent answers positive, negative or neutral to the question. 


\subsection{Weighted Indicator}

As described in \autoref{sec:Weighting procedure} and \autoref{sec:Globalisation procedure}, each respondent has two different weights: one according to its size, one according to the size of the sector it's part of. Those weight are then combined and we end up with a specific weight.
We have now the following equation for the indicator

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\omega_i x_i \right) \quad \text{  where  } \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i =  1
\end{equation} 

where
$x_i$ is the answer of the respondent $i$ and can take values -1, 0 and 1.
$\omega_i$ is the weight of respondent $i$. 
The weights are here standardised so there sum is equal to one.

As for the unweighted indicator, we can decompose the equation by the three possible answers with, in this case, their according weights.

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{+i} x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{0i} x_{0i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{-i} x_{-i}
 \end{equation}
and again we know that $\sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{0i} x_{0i} = 0$, so we can write

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{+i} x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{-i} x_{-i}
\end{equation} 
We also know that $x_{+i} = 1$  and $x_{-i}=-1$  
\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{+i}  - \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{-i}
\end{equation}
That will be written as follow
\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \Omega \pi_+ - \Omega \pi_- \label{eq: BSI Weighted}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega \pi_+$ and $\Omega \pi_-$ are the weighted proportion of respondents answering positive and negative. this equation will be used for the same reasons as for the unweighted indicator. 
Same explanation also works here

$\pi$ is use here also in the probabilistic way as it can also be seen as the probability that a respondent answers positive, negative or neutral ($\pi_0$) with $\pi_+ + \pi_0 + \pi_- =1$.


From \autoref{eq: BSI Unweighted} and \autoref{eq: BSI Weighted} it can be seen that the weighted and unweighted indicators are bounded between -1 and 1. In the two cases, the indicator is the smallest if everyone has a negative answer, and is the largest when every answer is positive.

\subsection{Take different questions into account}

The previous calculations where specific to each question. The published indicators are usually taking different survey questions into account. For example the Industry indicator that we will be interested in is composed of four questions that have all the same weight:

\begin{equation}
    \mbox{Industry business indicator}\ = \frac{E(X_{Q1}) + E(X_{Q2}) + E(X_{Q3}) + E(X_{Q4})}{4}
\end{equation}

where 
$E(X_{Q1})$, $E(X_{Q2})$, $E(X_{Q3})$ and $E(X_{Q4})$ are the different averages for question 18, 27, 32 and 33 (can be weighted or unweighted)

can also been seen as the mean of the answers for each participant at each period then combined together

\begin{equation}
    \mbox{Industry business survey indicator}\ = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_{i Q1} + x_{i Q2} + x_{i Q3} + x_{i Q4} \right)}{4n}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mbox{Industry BSI}\ = \frac{\pi_{Q1+} + \pi_{Q2+} + \pi_{Q3+} + \pi_{Q4+} - \pi_{Q1-} - \pi_{Q2-} - \pi_{Q3-} - \pi_{Q4-} }{4}
\end{equation}


\begin{eqnarray}
    \mbox{ Weighted Industry BSI}\ &=& 1/4 ( \pi_{Q1+} + \Omega \pi_{Q2+} + \Omega \pi_{Q3+} + \Omega \pi_{Q4+} \\
    && - \Omega \pi_{Q1-} - \Omega \pi_{Q2-} - \Omega \pi_{Q3-} - \Omega \pi_{Q4-} \Large) 
\end{eqnarray}

Generalisation !


\chapter{The Variance of the Indicator}

The variance is, with the mean, one of the first tool for Statisticians to study a certain variable. Next to the mean, that is the average value of a certain variable, the variance is the measure of the dispersion. 
In the context of the business survey, the variance haven't been used much, while it can be seen as "how much people agree", an important information that we can extract from the survey.

The variance will be interpreted as to what level respondents agree about the state of the Belgian economy.

% A small comment can be written regarding the difference between the variance and sampling error. The idea here is not the study accuracy or ... but rather to find new information hidden in the survey.

This chapter will present the calculation of the variance of the unweighted and weighted indicator.
It will then look into the properties and specificities of the variance of the business survey indicator.

% As done for the indicator, two different variances will be take into account here, the weighted and the unweighted variance of the indicator.


\section{Variance of the Unweighted Indicator}

% \cite{alcaniz_calculation_2006}

\nocite{alcaniz_calculation_2006}

The formula of the variance can be written as 
\begin{eqnarray}
         \Var(X) &=& E \left[ \left(X-E(X) \right)^2 \right] =  E\left( X^2\right) - E\left( X\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}

In the case of one question of the business survey indicator, we can write and develop the equation as follow

\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=&  E\left( X^2\right) - E\left( X\right)^2 \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
    &=& \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}^2}{n} \right) + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{0i}^2}{n} \right) + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}^2}{n} \right) - E(X)^2 \\ \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}


The positive and negative answers take value -1 and 1, which means that $x_{+i}^2 = x_{+i}$, $x_{-i}^2 = |x_{-i}|$. We also know that $\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{Ni}^2}{n} \right) = 0$. 
With this information, we can further simplify the equation;

\begin{eqnarray}
	\Var(X) &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - E ( X )^2 \label{var1} \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

In other words, the variance of the BSI is equal to the sum of the proportion of positive and negative answers, minus the squared indicator. \\
We can also replace $\E(X)$  by $\pi_+ - \pi_-$, and/or $\pi_+ + \pi_-$ by $ 1 - \pi_0$ (since $\pi_+ \pi_0 + \pi_- = 1$).
Which means that we have several different ways to write the previous equation;

\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - E ( X )^2  \nonumber \\
        &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - ( \pi_+ - \pi_- )^2 \label{var2} \\
	    &=& 1 - \pi_0 - E(X)^2 \label{var3}
\end{eqnarray}




\section{Variance of the Weighted Indicator}

We can now do the same for the weighted indicator. The equation is very similar as for the variance of the unweighted variance;



\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=&  E\left( X^2\right) - E\left( X\right)^2 \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
    &=& \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i x_{+i}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i x_{0i}^2  + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i x_{-i}^2 - E(X)^2 \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}

We can here, as we did for the indicator, take into account weighted proportion and write the equation the same way as for the unweighted variance but in this case, by taking the weighted proportions. Again the variance can be written in different ways, depending on the interpretation that fits best;

\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=& \Omega \pi_+ + \Omega \pi_- - ( \Omega \pi_+ - \Omega \pi_- )^2 \\
	&=& \Omega \pi_+ + \Omega \pi_- - E ( X )^2 \\
	&=& 1 - \Omega \pi_{0} - E(X)^2
\end{eqnarray}

\end{figure}


Based on the previous development of the equation of the variance of the indicator, we can make some observations.

First of all, the variance is bounded between 0 and 1. 
A variance can't be negative since it's a sum of squares, so the lower bound shouldn't surprise anyone. On the other hand, the upper bound is more unusual. The most interesting approach is to take  \autoref{var3} and see that $\pi_0$ and $\E(X)^2$ can only take positive values. Since both the variables have a minus sign in front of them, to have the highest result they should both be equal to zero. 
This means that the highest variance, $\Var(X)=1$, is obtained when no respondent answer "neutral" and the BSI is equal to 0, in other words, half of the respondents answer "positive" while the other half answer "negative". 
On the other hand, the variance will be equal to zero if all the participant answer the same, that's "negative", "neutral" or "positive".

Another approach to better understand the variance of the business survey barometer, is to plot the different possible values of $\Var(X)$, $\pi_0$ and $\E(X)$ from \autoref{var3}. The results can be seen in \autoref{fig:var properties}.

Their are different observations that can be done from the plot;
(1) there is a specific upper and lower bound for each BSI

upper bound : 
\begin{equation}
    \Var(X) = 1 - 0 - \E(X)^2
\end{equation}

lower bound : 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=& X - X^2 \quad \text{where } \Var(X) \text{ is between -1 and 0} \\
    &=& - (\E(X) + 0,5)^2 + 0,25 
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    \Var(X) &=& - X - X^2 \quad \text{where } \Var(X) \text{ is between 0 and 1} \\
        &=&  - (\E(X) - 0,5)^2 + 0,25
\end{eqnarray}
    

\section{Take different questions into account}

As already seen, the published indicator take different questions into account. 
The combination of the variance of different questions is slightly more complex than the combination of different indicators since the questions are correlated, which means that covariance has to be taken into account.

The formula to combine different variances is the following

\begin{equation}
\Var \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \Cov\left(X_{i}, X_{j}\right)
= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Var\left(X_{i}\right)+2 \sum_{1 \leq i<j \leq n} \Cov\left(X_{i}, X_{j}\right)
\end{equation}

In the case of combining the variances of four different questions of the business survey, we have the following equation

\begin{eqnarray}
    \Var \left(\frac{X_{Q1} + X_{Q2} + X_{Q3} + X_{Q4}}{4} \right) &=& \frac{1}{16} \large[ \Var(X_{Q1}) + \Var(X_{Q2}) + \Var(X_{Q3}) + \Var(X_{Q4}) \nonumber \\
    && + 2 \Cov (X_{Q1},X_{Q2}) + 2 \Cov (X_{Q1},X_{Q3}) + 2 \Cov (X_{Q1},X_{Q4}) \nonumber \\
    &&  + 2 \Cov (X_{Q2},X_{Q3}) + 2 \Cov (X_{Q2},X_{Q4}) + 2 \Cov (X_{Q3},X_{Q4}) \large] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The complexity of the formula encourage to rather calculate the indicator (taking all the questions into account), and then calculate the variance of that indicator, we can write it as follow

\begin{eqnarray}
    \Var \left(\frac{X_{Q1} + X_{Q2} + X_{Q3} + X_{Q4}}{4} \right) 
    &=& \frac{1}{16} \Var \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_{i Q1} + x_{i Q2} + x_{i Q3} + x_{i Q4} \right)}{n} \right) \nonumber \\
    &=& \frac{1}{16} \Var \left(\pi_{1+} + \pi_{2+} + \pi_{3+} + \pi_{4+} - \pi_{1-} - \pi_{2-} - \pi_{3-} - \pi_{4-}  \right) \nonumber \\
 %   &=& \frac{1}{16} \Var \left(\pi_{1+} + \pi_{2+} + \pi_{3+} + \pi_{4+} - \pi_{1-} - \pi_{2-} - \pi_{3-} - \pi_{4-} \right) \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}

The generalisation of the previous equation can be written as follow

\begin{eqnarray}
    \Var \left(\frac{X_{Q1} + X_{Q2} + \ldots + X_{Qn}}{n_Q} \right) 
    &=& \frac{1}{n_Q^2} \Var \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_{i Q1} + x_{i Q2} + ... + x_{i Qn} \right)}{n} \right) \nonumber \\
    &=& \frac{1}{n_Q^2} \Var \left(\pi_{1+} + \pi_{2+} + \ldots + \pi_{n+} - \pi_{1-} - \pi_{2-} - \ldots - \pi_{n-} \right) \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}

\chapter{The Indicator of the Evolution of Individual Responses}

In the same logic as for the variance, a proposition is done here of a way to extract more information out of the business survey. 
As explained in the first chapter, the business survey is answered by the same companies over time, there are some new recruits and companies leaving the survey, but the survey can be referred to as a panel survey.
Is it possible to have more information by taking taking the evolution of the individual respondents into account ? 

This chapter will address this question by applying a method proposed by \cite{caron_estimation_1996} that, by taking all the individual evolution of responses into account, offers a method to calculate an indicator that will be called the indicator of the evolution of individual responses (EIR).

First the calculation will be described for the and the intuition will be developed .


We will here describe and develop this indicator, that we will call Evolution of individual Responses (EIR).
It can be understood as the indicator of the changes in individual answers between t-1 and t.

As for the variance, The EIR has no ambition of replacing the BSI but rather to propose an addition information.

\subsubsection{Explanation}

To understand this new indicator, it's important to see that if we take only one period into account, there are three different possibilities of answers; "negative", "neutral" and "positive". 
When we take two periods into account, a month (t) and the previous one (t-1) for example, there are nine possible situations as represented in \autoref{tab:EIR explanation}. 
We can again see that $\pi$ is used since we will speak about proportions and probabilities of been in a certain group, as done before.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r | r | c c c | }
    \multicolumn{1}{r}{} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{} &	\multicolumn{3}{c}{$t$} \\ \cline{3-5}
    \multicolumn{1}{r}{} & 		& \textbf{-} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{+} \\ \cline{2-5}
    		&    \textbf{-} & $z_{i--}$	& $z_{i-0}$	& $z_{i-+}$ \\ 
    $t-1$ & \textbf{0} & $z_{i0-}$	& $z_{i00}$	& $z_{i0+}$	\\
    		&    \textbf{+} & $z_{i+-}$	& $z_{i+0}$	& $z_{i++}$ \\ \cline{2-5}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Possible observation when taking t and t-1 into account}
    \label{tab:EIR explanation}
\end{table}{}

The same as for the BSI, the EIR take different values. In the case of the BSI, if the answer was negative, it would take value "-1", neutral it would take value "0" and positive it would take value "1".

The EIR defers in the sens that it's a measure of change, so if the answer of a certain respondent is the same at a certain time and at the previous survey, $x=0$. 
On the other hand, if a certain participant changes his answer for a more positive answer it will take value 1, except if it's a radical change from a "negative" to a "positive" answer, then it will take value 2.
Same the other way around, if it decreases it will take value -1, except for a radical change from "positive" to "negative".
We will here use $z$ rather than $x$ to make a clear distinction between the BSI and the EIR.

A summary to better understand this new indicator can be seen in \autoref{tab:values EIR}.

\section{Indicator of the Unweighted Evolution of Individual Responses}

% \begin{equation}
%    \pi_{++} + \pi_{+0} + \pi_{+-} + \pi_{0+} + \pi_{00} + \pi_{0-} + \pi_{-+} + \pi_{-0} + \pi_{--} = 1
% \end{equation}

The Indicator of the evolution of the individual responses can be obtained by taking the mean of the values, as defined in \autoref{tab:values EIR}, the formula is then

\begin{eqnarray}
    \E(Z) &=&  \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n z_i}{n} \\ \nonumber \\
        &=& \left( \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n z_{--i}}{n} \right)
     + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{-0i} }{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{-+i}}{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{0-i} }{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{00i} }{n} \right) \nonumber  \\
    &&  + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{0+i}}{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{+-i} }{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{+0i} }{n} \right)
    + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{+-i}}{n} \right)
\end{eqnarray}

As for the indicator, we will now move from individual responses, to proportions, that can be seen in \autoref{tab:EIR proportions}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r | r | c c c | }
    \multicolumn{1}{r}{} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{} &	\multicolumn{3}{c}{$t$} \\ \cline{3-5}
    \multicolumn{1}{r}{} & 		& \textbf{-} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{+} \\ \cline{2-5}
    		&    \textbf{-} & $\pi_{--}$	& $\pi_{-0}$	& $\pi_{-+}$ \\ 
    $t-1$ & \textbf{0} & $\pi_{0-}$	& $\pi_{00}$	& $\pi_{0+}$	\\
    		&    \textbf{+} & $\pi_{+-}$	& $\pi_{+0}$	& $\pi_{++}$ \\ \cline{2-5}
    \end{tabular}    
    \caption{Possible observation when taking t and t-1 into account}
    \label{tab:EIR proportions}
\end{table}

The EIR can now be calculated with the following expression after taking out $\pi_{--}$, $\pi_{00}$ and $\pi_{++}$ since $z_{--}$, $z_{00}$ and $z_{++}$ have value zero.

\begin{equation}
    \E(Z) = \pi_{0+} + \pi_{-0} - \pi_{+0} - \pi_{0-} +2\pi_{-+} -2\pi_{+-} 
\end{equation}

where $\pi$ is the proportion/probability of respondent answering negative(-), neutral (0) and positive (+) at $t-1$ and $t$.

\section{Generalisation for n time frames}

Changes in the economy are usually taking several months to influence all the companies. There can be some lag of effects on for example larger companies, of a very specific sector.
The idea of only taking a certain month and the previous month can seems non-sufficient, it's relevant to take a larger period into account. 

Different methods where explored to take more than two periods into account, but it was found as been flawed and very complex to interpret.
We rather propose here a simple generalisation; use t-n rather than t-1. You compare then that period t-n with the the answer at t, without taking the between answers into account.

\subsubsection{t-n vs t}

come up to the same except that you use a larger period into account


\chapter{The Variance of the Evolution of Individual Responses} \label{Chapter:Var Z}

The new indicator, the evolution of individual responses, also has a variance that has some interpretation interest. 
While the EIR is a measure of in which direction companies change there answer, the variance of the EIR can be understood as the measure of changes in answers. Therefore the Var(EIR) can be seen as the volatility of the indicator, in the sens that the variance of the EIR account for the dispersion of the difference in answers over a two times period.

\subsubsection{difference var(BSI) \& var(EIR)}

That we will also call the volatility of the indicator, in the sens that the variance of the evolution of the indicator account for the dispersion of the difference in answers over a two times period.

% In this case, the highest the variance of EIR, will be obtained when half of the companies went from a negative answer to a positive answer and the other half did the opposite and changed from a positive answer at t-1 to a negative answer at t. 

The idea is that this variance of EIR is complementary to the estimation of Z since they have two very interesting but different interpretations.
Further interpretation will be

\chapter{Non-Response, Dropout, Attrition and Seasonal Effects}
\label{chap:nonresponse dropout}

Before we model the data, it's important to look at the different effects that could mislead the outcome of the analysis. After exploring the data and doing a literature review, there are four effects that could mislead the results. Three are due to the survey and one to external effects, seasonal effects. We will first look into the three survey based issues; non-response, dropout and attrition, and will then explain the seasonal correction applied to the data.

\end{table}



\section{Non-Response}

Non-response is one of the most studied issues in Surveying. Indeed it is a large issue

two ways 
- non participation to the survey
- participating but not answering 

- non participation to the survey
has already been mentioned before, the stratified procedure should avoid as much as possible it, and in the main time, since the importance is the evolution of the Indicator.

- participating but not answering 
 solved by the National Bank by filling the non-answering by the previous response of the participant. 
The response rate is usually around 95\% for the business survey. We could from there say that non-response is not very important. 
Before concluding it, since the mean study is the evolution rather than the indicator in it self, we plotted the non-response with the evolution of the Year on Year GDP to see if there seems to be a relation between the two. For example we could expect more or less non-response during crises or in certain economy situations. Since the main interest of the BSI is to explain Business cycles,
this could be an issue.

plot non-response



\section{Dropout and Attrition}

Those two issues are related to the structure and organisation of the survey. As explain in \autoref{sec:Recruitment of participants}, ones participants are recruited to participate in the business survey, they stay as long as they want. This brings to major potential issues: dropout and attrition

\subsection{Dropout}

Participants leaving the survey, are they different from 

The National Bank doesn't keep track from reasons why participants leave the survey. From discussions with the employees at the NBB, the two mean reasons are (1) the company going bankrupt, acquired or merged and (2) the responsible person at the company leaves his job there and the new responsible person doesn't see the interest in participating anymore.
This is an issue, since it means that it's a certain type of profiles that leave the survey. If this type of profile have a different opinion or respond differently than the remaining companies this will create bias. 

This is the case

It could be argued that the bias is very diffused due to the small amount of companies leaving the survey each month. Again the fact that the evolution is important, means that we have a very small bias for each month (if we take a long period into account then the bias become larger) we are only comparing month to month evolution, and when the business survey is published, the 3-4 last year are showed.

It's not the subject of this work, so will not dive more into this bias, but we would recommend to have a closer look into this.

\subsection{Attrition}
Attrition, also called Panel Conditioning, is present when participants change there behaviour between different rounds of sampling. 
A very interesting master thesis was done about the Belgian Labour Force Survey, where attrition was found to be significant \cite{priyana_hardjawidjaksana_investigating_2019}. 
The Belgian Labour Force Survey was convenient to test for attrition, since it's a survey where respondents reply four times to the same survey with a lag of six months.

In the case of the Business Industry Survey it's a harder to test for it since we have only two major periods of recruitment for the period at interest (1988 - 2018); in the early 1900 and between XXX and XXXX with some company 

plot of the amount of recruited over time

Two possible indicators to show the presence of Attrition, is the correlation between time and variance(BSI) and the correlation between time and variance(EIR).

\section{Seasonal Effects and Correction}
The National Bank, before publishing the business survey indicator, applies a X11 seasonal correction.

The literature about seasonal effects is very rich and variate


\subsubsection{JDemetra+}

% most widely used and recommended -12-ARIMA2/X-13ARIMA-SEATS3 developed at the U.S. Census Bureau and TRAMO/SEATS4 developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall, from the Bank of Spain. Both methods are divided into two main parts. The first part is called pre-adjustment and removes deterministic effects from the series by means of a regression model with ARIMA noise. The second part is the decomposition of the time series to estimate and re-move a seasonal component. TRAMO/SEATS and X-12-ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS use a very similar approach in the first part to estimate the same model on the processing step, but they differ completely in the decomposition step. Therefore, comparing results from decomposition is often difficult. Furthermore, their diagnostics focus on different aspects and their outputs take completely different forms.  

The department of Research and development of the NBB developed JDemetra+ and has since been recommended by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) for all National Statistics Institutes (NSI) of the European Union. 


Test for seasonality where done with JDemetra (see appendix \autopageref{sec:test for seasonality}) and it was concluded that there was seasonal effect for each of the variables at hand.

Test stationarity of the time series (ADF)
In order to test the stationarity of the time series, let’s run the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test using the adf.test() function from the tseries R package.

First set the hypothesis test:

The null hypothesis H0 : that the time series is non stationary The alternative hypothesis HA : that the time series is stationary

The interest of this paper is to study the variance of the business survey indicator and explore the possible interest of the indicator of the evolution in individual responses. To achieve this objective, it's important to chose a model that account easily for the interest of each model


Better model could be used; Linear Autoregressive, ARIMA, State Space Models, ... but here interest is to ...

\chapter{Conclusion}

A large 

It was seen that


High correlation between var(BSI) and var(EIR) -> people seems to change in the same direction


\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Recruitment procedure and panel data}
not real sampling theory



\section{Z that takes more periods into account}



\section{Limitations}

\subsection*{Variance influence by drop-out, attrition, ...}

\section{Improve the business survey}

\subsubsection*{Change participants}

\subsubsection*{Mo}
From a statisticians point of view, a more sampling theory Including SRS or else would be more optimal

\subsubsection{leave question 18 out of NS975}

\section{Further Research}



More complex Nowcasting model with Space space models / MIDAS ....

Combine mixed models and Markov Chain for Panel Data \citep{de_haan-rietdijk_use_2017}
