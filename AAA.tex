\chapter{The Business Survey Indicator}

This chapter is a presentation of the Belgian business survey and the business survey indicator, also referred to as the business survey barometer or business confidence barometer/indicator.
We will first go thought the evolution of the barometer since it started. Then present the recruitment method, the objectives and methodology of they survey. 
In the last part of the chapter, we will present the calculation method of the business survey indicator (BSI).

\section{History}

The Belgian Business Survey celebrates this year it's 65\textsuperscript{th} anniversary, since the Survey was launched by the National Bank of Belgium in 1954. 
Belgium was part of the pioneers since only the US (19XX) and XXX (19XX) had a business survey.

In 1972, the results where first synthesised in an indicator.
The Business Survey Barometer started by including only the industrial sector. It was then small by small enlarged to other sectors: construction, trade and services (1994).

At the European level, it was in 1961 that the European Commission launched an harmonisation program of the Business Survey in the manufacturing industry. 
Since then, the sector coverage of the programme has widened considerably. The Business Survey programme was extended to the construction sector and the investment plans in the manufacturing sector in 1966, to consumers in 1972, to the retail trade in 1984, and to the services sector in 1996.
The harmonisation only concerns the type of questions, the possible answers and the method to calculate the indicator. ...
More information ca be found in the "The Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys User Guide" \cite{european_commission_joint_2016}.

Over the time, the business survey barometer has been well known for been a very informative and useful indicator. 
It was noticed in a paper by the Wall Street Journal titled \textit{"Euroland Discovers A Surprise Indicator: Belgian Confidence"} \citep{rhoads_euroland_1999} that acknowledged its importance and accuracy in understanding the evolution of the Belgian economy.

% For example in 1999 an article was published in the Wall Street Journal titled \textit{"Euroland Discovers A Surprise Indicator: Belgian Confidence"} \citep{rhoads_euroland_1999} that noted the accuracy of its predictions.

Due to the structure of Belgian economy ... it was also shown as been a good predictor for the European economy \cite{vanhaelen_belgian_2000}

Today, Nowcasting is a well studied subject and very important for public and private organisation to have an as clear as possible view of the state of the economy.

Several improvement of the business survey where proposed and applied over time (1983, 1990 and 2009). The last ?improvements will be discussed in detail in \autoref{section:Methodology}.


\section{Sampling Method}
\label{sec:Recruitment of participants}

The Belgian business survey barometer (as most of the business survey around the world), has the particularity of not using random sampling.
The selection of participants is quite complex and a lot of decision are "human decisions". Never is a statistical program or a random sampling system used to select new participants.

\subsubsection{Procedure of selection}

% Without going to much into details. 
The selections of new participants is done by "waves". When the department responsible for the business survey at the NBB decides that there aren't enough participants in a specific sector anymore, the recruitment of new participants is launched. 

To find the new participants, the first step is to decided for an optimal amount of new participants needed, regarding the different stratification of the sector.
Each sector is composed of a quite advanced trees of sub-sectors, sub-sub-sectors, ... . for example the industry sector is divided into more than 300 sub-sectors / branches over 6 different levels. A representation of the classification ca be seen in \autoref{fig:tree}.

% When a new recruitment procedure is started, it's looked at those branches to see, based on there importance in Belgian economy, which could take advantage of having more respondents. For example, if a certain sub-sector represents 1 \% of Belgian GDP but its respondents only present 0.1 \% of the respondents of the survey. It will be decided to look for more respondents for this sub-sector. This is a very simplified version of how this is done since there is also the size of the company that has to be taken into account, next to the size of the sub-sector. Therefore this procedure is quite complex and contains a lot human decisions.

As will be seen in \autoref{sec:Weighting procedure} and \autoref{sec:Globalisation procedure} more in details, companies are weighted by there size (profit, number of employees, ...) and the size of the sector/branch they are part of. 
Based on those information, it's looked at which branches, size of companies, new respondents should be looked for. 
This makes the procedure quite complex and therefore contains a lot of human decisions.
 
Out of this process comes a list of potential new participants. This list is then send to the communication department that takes  contact with those potential new participants. 
Not always, but it happens quite often, a representative of the National Bank visits the new participant to explain the survey and have a contact.
As a reward for participating at the survey, the companies receive privileged information. Each month they receive access to sub-sector indicators information that aren't publicly distributed. This can give them economical information regarding there specific economical activity.

At the National Bank of Belgium, this procedure is usually referred to as "prospecting" rather than selecting or sampling. Since it is mostly based on recruiting new companies that will work with them, by looking at the Belgian economy and find participants willing to collaborate. For example, it's possible that the responsible person for the Horeca business survey, goes to  restaurant et get acquainted with the owner, sees the interest of including him in the business survey and recruits him this way. This is a less common way, the main of the recruitment happens to the process explained above.


\subsubsection{Leaving the Survey}

An important side of business survey is that people are staying as long as possible in the survey.
Ones  companies are part of the survey, they stay in it until they decide to leave. There are no participants removed from the survey by the national Bank, what can happen is that if participants don't answer for three months, contact will be taken with the company to see if they want to continue to participate.

There is a real work done by the National Bank to make sure companies answer to the survey, and stay in the survey.
This means that some companies are part of the survey for a very long time.
To have an idea, if we look at the Survey for the Industry, trace respondents back to 1988, we can see that today, approximately one third of the respondents where already in the survey in 1988. 

\subsubsection{Why not a problem that Random Sampling isn't used}

% The National Bank of Belgium is using random or stratified sampling for other survey. So why isn't it the case here ?

From a statistical point of view, it can be rather problematic to draw general conclusions over a populations when Random Sampling is not use.
Without undermining one of the most important pillars of statistics, there are two main reasons why in this case, having a non-random selection of participants is not too problematic.

The first reason is that the method used tries to represent as good as possible the population that it wants to represent. Therefore stratification is used at a quite advanced level as explained before. 
We could call this recruitment method: non-random stratification, as opposed to random stratification. Since it's not using sampling but takes into account the stratification of the population it's studying.

The second reason ,the most import one, is that the business survey Indicator has no interest on its own. Indeed having a BSI equal to 0.5 or 0.1 don't mean anything, what's important is the evolution of the indicator. If it was equal to 0.3 last month and this month it's equal to 0.5, it means that the economy is most probably growing and that we can forecast an increase of GDP over the month. On the other hand if it's now equal to 0.1, it means a decrease in economical confidence among businesses and we can anticipate a deceleration/decrease of GDP over that period.

% This means that people participate for a long time to the survey will be discussed in chapter .... and ....


\section{Objective and Methodology}
\label{section:Objective}

\subsubsection{predictive power for the future months}
\subsubsection{high correlation with Economical Indicators}

The main objective of the business survey Barometer is to have a feeling of how the economy is now and how it will evolve in the short term. Therefore we will first speak about nowcasting, its explanation and its implications.


average weekly work hours in manufacturing, factory orders for goods, housing permits and stock prices
 index of consumer expectations, average weekly claims for unemployment insurance and the interest rate
 

\subsubsection{fluctuation that's mostly explained by the conjuncture}
The second objective of the Business Confidence Barometer, is to make prevision as less as possible influenced by short terms variation, but the capture the more long run evolution of the economy, more precisely, business cycles. Therefor we will here discuss business cycles.

In \autoref{chap:nonresponse dropout}, we will discuss most of the small, short-term variation that can influence the BSI while those aren't relevant. Those can be due to the responses to the survey (Attrition, non- response and ...) but also to "real" effects (seasonal effects) that shouldn't be captured by the BSI.


\subsection{Nowcasting}

Also called "flash" estimation, nowcasting has increasingly gain importance in the last decade (see \cite{foroni_comparison_2014}, \cite{de_antonio_liedo_nowcasting_2014}, ...).
it consists in the short term estimation of the economy, mostly the GDP.
It is a fundamental approach since the business survey indicator is published monthly while other indicator's like GDP are published quarterly.

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:timeline}, 
the lag between the observation and publication is even greater since the business survey Indicator is published at the end of each month (around the 24-25\textsuperscript{th} of each month, will the GDP is published with a lag of 3-4 weeks ????

Nowcasting got by the time a catch all word and include predictive models going from Linear models to space-space models and also including ARIMA or MIDAS and much more different models.

\subsection{Business Cycles}
\label{sec:Business Cycles}

Before going further, a small summary of business cycle theory. 

As already said, an important role of the business survey Indicator, is to identify business cycles.


The domain is very wide and a lot of books and articles where published about the subject. 

Already in 1946, \citeauthor{mitchell_measuring_1946} published the book "\textit{Measuring Business Cycles}". They 
Business cycles where described as recursive fluctuations, affecting macroeconomics variables.

Business cycles are putting aside other effects like seasonal variation and other small variations. It is taking into account a larger trend in the economy.

\subsubsection{What's GDP and Year on Year GDP}

As seen, business cycles are defined by several macroeconomic variables. 
Gross domestic income (GDI), unemployment, ...

But the main indicator, is the GDP

Later on we will also use YoY GDP, for x reasons

\begin{eqnarray}
   \mbox{YoY GDP} = \frac{\mbox{GDP}_t - \mbox{GDP}_{t-12}}{\mbox{GDP}_{t-12}} 
\end{eqnarray}

\autoref{fig:Business Cycle} shows a simplified version of the Business Cycles theory.

\subsubsection{Duration of a Business Cycle}

\autoref{fig:Business Cycle} can give the false impression that business cycles are of the same length, this is, in real life, not so simple.

\cite{mitchell_measuring_1946} stated a minimum duration of 16-22 months and a maximum duration of 100-106 months. This is a quite large range and since then several researches worked on this topic. There is no clear 

The empirical research , mostly done by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), showed that the time from one economic peak to the next is on average 5 and a halve years (for the period 1945-2009)

As we can see from \autoref{fig:NBER BS}, which represent the different though and peak of business cycles identified by the NBER from 1975 to 2009, there business cycles, even though they seems to have some ..., their is no symmetry of the Business Cycle.

\subsection{Specific direct information for sectors and sub-sectors}

This will be less prominent in this paper, but is important to mention, each month a quite long report is done based on the BSI for each sector and sub-sector.
The national bank use those information for more in depth analysis of Belgian Economy.


\subsection{Methodology}
\label{section:Methodology}

1954 begin
1972 results are synthesised in an indicator
1983 \& 1990 methodological changes

The latest large improvement of the business survey Indicator happened in 2009 which was explained in a working paper titled \textit{"The National Bank of Belgium’s new business survey indicator"} 
(\citeauthor{de_greef_national_2009})

- only take a limited amount of questions into account, the most relevant ones (3-4 questions) \\
- inclusion of the services in the global indicator \\
- lighten smoothing method

% Qualitative information



\subsection{Questionnaire}
\label{sec:Questionnaire}

\subsubsection{General presentation}

Almost the same for everyone, some differences depending on the sector (Industry $\neq$ Services)

Answers are giving by mail, email, on the phone or by fax.

The questionnaire exists in Dutch and French

The first question has to be interpreted the opposite way as of the three other questions. ...


\subsubsection{Changes over time}

Questionnaire in 1990 (See Appendix \autopageref{Questionnaire1990}) almost same as today  (See Appendix \autopageref{Questionnaire2018}). 

The difference is in the way of asking the question

Smaller influence of this since same people answering, slight changes in phrasing should have smaller consequences

see appendix \autopageref{Questionnaire2018} for the full questionnaire


\subsection{Weighting procedure}
\label{sec:Weighting procedure}

According to the size of the company, measured different ways depending on the sector ........

\subsection{Globalisation procedure}
\label{sec:Globalisation procedure}
Based on the size of the sector in which the company is.
The globalisation procedure got quite complex over time. See the globalisation tree for the Industry survey \autopageref{fig:tree}



\section{Calculation of the Indicator}

This section presents the method for calculating the indicator. 
The calculation in itself is standard, but the different ways to write it are important for interpretation and to better understand the following chapters.

\subsection{Unweighted Indicator}

The calculation of the unweighted indicator for a specific question at a specific time can be written as follow;

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
\end{equation} 
where 

$x_i$ is the answer of the respondent i and can each take value -1 (negative), 0 (neutral) and 1 (positive). 
$n$ is the total of respondents

Since x can only take three different values, we can decompose it into 

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{Ni} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 

where 

$x_{+i}$, $x_{Ni}$ and $x_{-i}$ are the positive (+), neutral (N) and negative (-) answers of the respondent i

We know that $\sum_{i=1}^n x_{Ni} = 0$ so we can write

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}}{n}  + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 

${\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}}/{n}$ is the proportion of positive answers and ${\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}}/{n}$ is the negative proportion of negative answer so for simplicity will write it 

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \pi_+ - \pi_-
\end{equation}

where $\pi_+$ and $\pi_-$ are the proportion of respondents answering positive and negative. 
$\pi$ can be interpreted as the probability that a respondent answers positive, negative or neutral to the question. 

Where $\pi_+ + \pi_N + \pi_- =1$.


\subsection{Weighted Indicator}

As described in \autoref{sec:Weighting procedure} and \autoref{sec:Globalisation procedure}, each respondent has two different weights: one according to its size, one according to the size of the sector it's part of.

Therefore we have now the following equation

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\omega_i p_i x_i \right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i p_i}
\end{equation} 
where \\
$x_i$ is the answer of the respondent i and can take values -1, 0 and 1 \\
$p_i$ is the weight of the globalisation of the company i \\
$\omega_i$ is the weight of the company i \\
where $\sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i = 1$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{+i} p_{+i} x_{+i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{Ni} p_{Ni} x_{Ni} + \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{-i} p_{-i} x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{+i} p_{+i} x_{+i}}{n} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{-i} p_{-i} x_{-i}}{n}
\end{equation} 


\begin{equation}
    E(X) = \pi_+ - \pi_-
\end{equation}

where $\pi_+$ and $\pi_-$ are the \textbf{weighted} proportion of respondents answering positive and negative. $\pi$ is use here also in the probabilistic way as it can also be seen as the probability that a respondent answers positive, negative or neutral ($\pi_0$) with $\pi_+ + \pi_0 + \pi_- =1$.




\subsection{?Properties}

\subsubsection{lower bound at -1 and upper bound at 1}

The BSI is the smallest if everyone has a negative answer and then the BSI = -1. 
And it's the largest when every answer is positive which means BSI = 1

\subsubsection{???}




\subsection{Take different questions into account}

The previous calculations where specific to each question. The published indicators are usually taking different survey questions into account. For example the Industry indicator that we will be interested in is composed of four questions that have all the same weight:

\begin{equation}
    \mbox{Industry Business Indicator}\ = \frac{E(X_{Q1}) + E(X_{Q2}) + E(X_{Q3}) + E(X_{Q4})}{4}
\end{equation}

where 
$E(X_{Q1})$, $E(X_{Q2})$, $E(X_{Q3})$ and $E(X_{Q4})$ are the different averages for question 18, 27, 32 and 33 (can be weighted or unweighted)

can also been seen as the mean of the answers for each participant at each period then combined together

\begin{equation}
    \mbox{Industry Business Indicator}\ = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_{i Q1} + x_{i Q2} + x_{i Q3} + x_{i Q4} \right)}{4n}
\end{equation}


\chapter{The Variance of the Indicator}

The variance is, with the mean, one of the first tool for Statisticians to study a certain variable.
In the context of the business survey, the variance haven't been used much. While it could be containing a lot of information.

This chapter will .........

We will then, in later chapters, look at it correlations and its possible predictive power.


As done for the Indicator, two different variances will be take into account here, the weighted and the unweighted variance of the indicator.

\section{Interpretation}
Variance as a measure of the dispersion of the responses.

The variance has the interest of been a measure of the dispersion of the observations. 

Here we want to know to what extend respondents agree with each others. The variance will the the measure of it. 
Measure of the "dispersion" of the answers.

This means that

\section{Variance of the Unweighted Indicator}

The main variance

cite

\begin{eqnarray}
     \Var(X) &=& E \left[ \left(X-E(X) \right)^2 \right] \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
     &=& E\left( X^2\right) - E\left( X\right)^2 \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
     &=& \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{+i}^2}{n} \right) + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{Ni}^2}{n} \right) + \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{-i}^2}{n} \right) - E(X)^2  \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
     &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - ( \pi_+ - \pi_- )^2 \label{var1}
\end{eqnarray}

Since $\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{Ni}^2}{n} \right) = 0$ ,
$x_{+i}^2 = x_{+i}$, $x_{-i}^2 = x_{-i}$
and $E(X) = \pi_+ - \pi_-$


We then have several different ways to write the previous equation;
\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - ( \pi_+ - \pi_- )^2 \nonumber \\
	&=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - E ( X )^2 \label{var2} \\
	&=& 1 - \pi_n - E(X)^2 \label{var3}
\end{eqnarray}

I other words, the variance of the BSI is equal to the proportion of negati...

\section{Variance of the Weighted Indicator}

\begin{equation}
\Var(X) = \frac{1}{\sum \omega_i p_i } \sum^N _{i=1} \omega_i p_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2
\end{equation}

\begin{eqnarray}
\Var(X) &=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - ( \pi_+ - \pi_- )^2 \\
	&=& \pi_+ + \pi_- - E ( X )^2 \\
	&=& 1 - \pi_0 - E(X)^2

\section{Discussion regarding the 'true variance'}

There is another way to calculate the variance that have been ignored for, that is calculating the variance for each lowest group of globalisation, and then combine those calculated variances.


Interestingly, it have been calculated for several questions of the business barometer, and it is approximately 10 times smaller than the variance based on all the answer a ones.



The reasons why it will not be used here
- losing information
- weight of globalisation taken into account in the weighted variance




\chapter{The Indicator of the Evolution of Individual Responses}

 \subsubsection{Why this new indicator}

Also Called Z indicator

Can be better understood as the indicator of the changes in individual answers between t-1 and t

cite the paper by INSEE 1996 \cite{caron_estimation_1996}

An issue for this indicator was to find an optimal name for it so that it would be easily understand by the largest number.
 

\section{Indicator of the Unweighted Evolution of Individual Responses}
\subsubsection{Explain the new indicator}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r | r | c c c | }
\multicolumn{1}{r}{} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{} &	\multicolumn{3}{c}{$t$} \\ \cline{3-5}
\multicolumn{1}{r}{} & 		& \textbf{-} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{+} \\ \cline{2-5}
		&    \textbf{-} & $\pi_{--}$	& $\pi_{-0}$	& $\pi_{-+}$ \\

		&    \textbf{+} & $\pi_{+-}$	& $\pi_{+0}$	& $\pi_{++}$ \\ \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}    
\end{center}

where

\begin{equation}
\pi_{++} + \pi_{+0} + \pi_{+-} + \pi_{0+} + \pi_{00} + \pi_{0-} + \pi_{-+} + \pi_{-0} + \pi_{--} = 1
\end{equation}

The Indicator of the evolution of the individual responses can be obtained by

\begin{equation}
E(Z) = \pi_{0+} + \pi_{-0} - \pi_{+0} - \pi_{0-} +2\pi_{-+} -2\pi_{+-} 
\end{equation}

where
$\pi$ is the proportion/probability of respondent answering (-,0,+) at $t-1$ and $t$ 


\begin{equation}
E(Z) = \pi_{0+} + \pi_{-0} - \pi_{+0} - \pi_{0-} +2\pi_{-+} -2\pi_{+-} = 
\begin{tabular}{r|r r r}
    			& \textbf{-} & \textbf{0} & \textbf{+} \\\hline

\section{Generalisation for n time frames}

Changes in the economy are usually taking several months to 

Therefore it's interesting to take a larger period into account.

There are mainly to ways to generalise this method. \\ A simple generalisation is to use t-n rather than t-1. You compare then that period t-n with the the answer at t, without taking the between answers into account.

Another generalisation is as follow

\subsection{t-n vs t}

come up to the same except that you use a larger period into account

\chapter{The Variance of the Evolution of Individual Responses (Volatility of Responses)} \label{Chapter:Z}

That we will also call the \textbf{volatility of the indicator}, in the sens that the variance of the evolution of the indicator account for the dispersion of the difference in answers over a two times period.

In this case, the highers variance of Z, will be obtained when half of the companies went from a negative answer to a positive answer and the other half did the opposite and changed from a positive answer at t-1 to a negative answer at t. 

waza see Chapter \ref{Chapter:Z}

The idea is that this variance of Z is complementary to the estimation of Z since they have two very interesting but different interpretations.
Further interpretation will be

\chapter{Non-Response, Dropout, Attrition and Seasonal Effects}
\label{chap:nonresponse dropout}

Before we model the data, it's important to look at the different effects that could mislead the outcome of the analysis. After exploring the data and doing a literature review, there are four effects that could mislead the results. Three are due to the survey and one to external effects, seasonal effects. We will first look into the three survey based issues; non-response, dropout and attrition, and will then explain the seasonal correction applied to the data.

\end{table}



\section{Non-Response}

Non-response is one of the most studied issues in Surveying. Indeed it is a large issue

two ways 
- non participation to the survey
- participating but not answering 

- non participation to the survey
has already been mentioned before, the stratified procedure should avoid as much as possible it, and in the main time, since the importance is the evolution of the Indicator.

- participating but not answering 
 solved by the National Bank by filling the non-answering by the previous response of the participant. 
The response rate is usually around 95\% for the business survey. We could from there say that non-response is not very important. 
Before concluding it, since the mean study is the evolution rather than the indicator in it self, we plotted the non-response with the evolution of the Year on Year GDP to see if there seems to be a relation between the two. For example we could expect more or less non-response during crises or in certain economy situations. Since the main interest of the BSI is to explain Business cycles,
this could be an issue.

plot non-response



\section{Dropout and Attrition}

Those two issues are related to the structure and organisation of the survey. As explain in \autoref{sec:Recruitment of participants}, ones participants are recruited to participate in the business survey, they stay as long as they want. This brings to major potential issues: dropout and attrition

\subsection{Dropout}

Participants leaving the survey, are they different from 

The National Bank doesn't keep track from reasons why participants leave the survey. From discussions with the employees at the NBB, the two mean reasons are (1) the company going bankrupt, acquired or merged and (2) the responsible person at the company leaves his job there and the new responsible person doesn't see the interest in participating anymore.
This is an issue, since it means that it's a certain type of profiles that leave the survey. If this type of profile have a different opinion or respond differently than the remaining companies this will create bias. 

This is the case

It could be argued that the bias is very diffused due to the small amount of companies leaving the survey each month. Again the fact that the evolution is important, means that we have a very small bias for each month (if we take a long period into account then the bias become larger) we are only comparing month to month evolution, and when the business survey is published, the 3-4 last year are showed.

It's not the subject of this work, so will not dive more into this bias, but we would recommend to have a closer look into this.

\subsection{Attrition}
Attrition, also called Panel Conditioning, is present when participants change there behaviour between different rounds of sampling. 
A very interesting master thesis was done about the Belgian Labour Force Survey, where attrition was found to be significant \cite{priyana_hardjawidjaksana_investigating_2019}. 
The Belgian Labour Force Survey was convenient to test for attrition, since it's a survey where respondents reply four times to the same survey with a lag of six months.

In the case of the Business Industry Survey it's a harder to test for it since we have only two major periods of recruitment between 1988 and 2018; in the early 1900 and between XXX and XXXX with some company 

plot of the amount of recruited over time

Two possible indicators to show the presence of Attrition, is the correlation between time and variance(BSI) and the correlation between time and variance(EIR).

corr(time,var(BSI))

corr(time,var(EIR))



Non parametric test \cite{das_nonparametric_2011}


\section{Seasonal Effects and Correction}
The National Bank, before publishing the business survey indicator, applies a X11 seasonal correction.

The literature about seasonal effects is very rich and variate


\subsubsection{JDemetra+}

% most widely used and recommended -12-ARIMA2/X-13ARIMA-SEATS3 developed at the U.S. Census Bureau and TRAMO/SEATS4 developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall, from the Bank of Spain. Both methods are divided into two main parts. The first part is called pre-adjustment and removes deterministic effects from the series by means of a regression model with ARIMA noise. The second part is the decomposition of the time series to estimate and re-move a seasonal component. TRAMO/SEATS and X-12-ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS use a very similar approach in the first part to estimate the same model on the processing step, but they differ completely in the decomposition step. Therefore, comparing results from decomposition is often difficult. Furthermore, their diagnostics focus on different aspects and their outputs take completely different forms.  

The department of Research and development of the NBB developed JDemetra+ and has since been recommended by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) for all National Statistics Institutes (NSI) of the European Union. 


Test for seasonality where done with JDemetra (see appendix \autopageref{sec:test for seasonality}) and it was concluded that there was seasonal effect for each of the variables at hand.

\chapter{Markov Switching Models}


\subsubsection{Small Introduction + why are we using it}

Since the pioneer work by \cite{hamilton_new_1989}, Markov Switching models have been largely used to model business cycles.


Markov Switching models have been very popular since \cite{hamilton_new_1989} to model business cycles and predict Turning points (see \cite{duprey_how_2017}, ...).

Able to predict the 2008 financial crisis if used MS-VAR model \cite{gadea_rivas_failure_2015}




\section{Model(s) Specification}

\subsection{Notation}

\begin{tabular}{l l}
    $S_t = \{0, 1\}$&   states        \\
    $N = 2$         &   number of states (2) \\
    $T = 372 $            & 	number of observations  \\
    $x_{t=1\dots T}$ & (hidden) state at time t \\
    $y_{t=1\dots T}$ 	& Change of the Industrial production indices at time t \\
    $p_{i=1\dots n,j=1\dots n}$ & probability of transition from state $i$ to state $j$ \\
    $F(y|\theta )$	&  probability distribution of an observation, parametrized on $\theta$ \\
%    $\theta_{i=1\dots N}$ & emission parameter for an observation associated with state $i$     \\
\end{tabular}



\subsection{Model}

\subsubsection{Model}



%%%\begin{equation*}
%%%    \varepsilon \sim iid(0,1)
%%%\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
y_{t} =   
  \begin{cases}
    \mu_{0} + \sum^p_{j = 1} \phi_j GDP_{t-j} + \epsilon_t      & \quad \text{if } S_t = 0 \\
    \mu_{1} + \sum^p_{j = 1} \phi_j GDP_{t-j} + \epsilon_t      & \quad \text{if } S_t = 1
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon \text{ is } N(0,\sigma_s)$


\begin{tabular}{l l}
    $\mu_{s} = \beta_0 = c_s = \alpha_s $    & regime-specific mean    \\
    $\beta_{s} = \phi_s$ & regime-specific  auto-regressive parameter \\
    $\sigma_{s}$ & regime-specific variance    \\

\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Transition equation/probability}

\begin{equation}
    P = P(S_t = s_t \mid S_{t-1} = s_{t-1}) = 
\left[ \begin{tabular}{c c}
            $1 - p_{t}$	& $p_{t}$ \\ 
            $q_{t}$	& $1 - q_{t}$ \\ 
\end{tabular} \right]
\end{equation}

We have then,

$P(S_t = 1 \mid S_{t-1} = 1) = p_t$   \\ 
$P(S_t = 0 \mid S_{t-1} = 1) = 1 - p_t$ \\
$P(S_t = 0 \mid S_{t-1} = 0) = q_t$   \\
$P(S_t = 1 \mid S_{t-1} = 0) = 1- q_t$ \\

or 

\begin{equation}
    P = P(S_t = s_t \mid S_{t-1} = s_{t-1}) = 
\left[ \begin{tabular}{c c}
            $1 - p_{t}$	& $p_{t} ..............$ \\ 
            $q_{t} ............$	& $1 - q_{t}$ \\ 
\end{tabular} \right]
\end{equation}
