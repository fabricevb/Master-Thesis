	abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic factor model that takes into account the calendar of European and Belgian intraquarterly data releases to automatically update GDP growth expectations or ‘nowcasts’ in real-time. Those updates can be decomposed in terms of all the forecast errors observed in every data release. This paper contributes to the literature that exploits qualitative surveys to anticipate macroeconomic variables, but this is the first analysis that isolates ‘quality’ from ‘timeliness’ as independent properties that can be expressed in function of the model parameters. The modeling framework allows for the incorporation of an heterogeneous information set including different kinds of survey data directly in levels. It also allows for the use of flash GDP and subsequent revisions as separate indicators without imposing strict assumptions regarding the rationality of the statistical agency. The empirical results emphasize the quality of survey data, which allows the model to produce accurate real GDP growth nowcasts for Belgium three months prior to the publication of the official flash estimate.},

In this article we deﬁne a general autoregressive MIDAS regression model with multiple variables of diﬀerent frequencies and show how it can be speciﬁed using the familiar R formula interface and estimated using various optimization methods chosen by the researcher. We discuss how to check the validity of the estimated model both in terms of numerical convergence and statistical adequacy of a chosen regression speciﬁcation, how to perform model selection based on a information criterion, how to assess forecasting accuracy of the MIDAS regression model and how to obtain a forecast aggregation of diﬀerent MIDAS regression models. We illustrate the capabilities of the package with a simulated MIDAS regression model and give two empirical examples of application of MIDAS regression.},

The model is designed to be used on a monthly basis by integrating monthly economic information through bridge models, for both supply and demand sides, allowing thus economic interpretations. For each GDP component, bridge equations are specified by using a general-to-specific approach implemented in an automated way by Hoover and Perez and improved by Krolzig and Hendry. This approach allows to select explanatory variables among a large data set of hard and soft data. A rolling forecast study is carried out to assess the forecasting performance in the prediction of aggregated GDP, by taking publication lags into account in order to run pseudo real-time forecasts. It turns out that the model outperforms benchmark models. The results show that changing the set of equations over the quarter is superior to keeping the same equations over time. In addition, GDP growth seems to be more precisely predicted from a supply-side approach rather than a demand-side approach.},

We investigate the behaviors of single indicator models, forecast combinations and factor models, in a pseudo realtime framework. MIDAS with an AR component performs quite well, and outperforms MFVAR at most horizons. Bridge equations perform well overall. Forecast pooling is superior to most of the single indicator models overall. Pooling information using factor models gives even better results. The best results are obtained for the components for which more economically related monthly indicators are available. Nowcasts of GDP components can then be combined to obtain nowcasts for the total GDP growth.},

	abstract = {For modelling mixed-frequency data with a business cycle pattern, we introduce the Markov-switching Mixed Data Sampling model with unrestricted lag polynomial (MS-UMIDAS). Usually, models of the MIDAS-class use lag polynomials of a specific function which impose some structure on the weights of the regressors included in the model. This may lead to a deterioration in the predictive power of the model if the structure imposed differs from the data generating process. When the difference between the available data frequencies is small and there is no risk of parameter proliferation, using an unrestricted lag polynomial might not only simplify the model estimation, but also improve its forecasting performance. We allow the parameters of the MIDAS model with an unrestricted lag polynomial to change according to a Markov-switching scheme in order to account for the business cycle pattern observed in many macroeconomic variables. Thus, we combine the unrestricted MIDAS with a Markov-switching approach and propose a new Markovswitching MIDAS model with unrestricted lag polynomial (MS-U-MIDAS). We apply this model to a large dataset with the help of factor analysis. Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical forecasting comparison carried out for the U.S. GDP growth show that the models of the MS-U-MIDAS class exhibit nowcasting and forecasting performances which are similar to or better than those of their counterparts with restricted lag polynomials.},

We discuss some in-sample properties of the estimator in a real-time environment and propose alternative methods for forecasting quarterly GDP with monthly factors. In the empirical application, we use a novel real-time dataset for the German economy. Employing a recursive forecast experiment, we evaluate the forecast accuracy of the factor model with respect to German GDP. Furthermore, we investigate the role of revisions in forecast accuracy and assess the contribution of timely monthly observations to the forecast performance. Finally, we compare the performance of the mixed-frequency model with that of a factor model, based on time-aggregated quarterly data.},

Bias and mean square error (MSE) for parameter estimates were examined. ML seemed to provide occasionally the best results in terms of bias, but hardly ever on MSE. All imputation methods at the scale level and logistic regression at item level hardly ever showed the best performance. The hybrid approach is similar or better than its original MI.

And its six straight months of improvement from last November -- when other European indicators were still diving -- suggest that a European rebound, and a stronger euro, are near.
"It's quite strange, really," concedes Mr. [Jean-Jacques] Vanhaelen, who leads the team that compiles the indicator but hesitates to read too much into it. "I would be very embarrassed if I told the ECB that Belgium is improving, so [you can] be sure that Europe is improving as well. I'd probably lose my job."
How can the modest Belgian economy accurately signal what's in store for Euroland, a region nearly 30 times its size by population? The most plausible explanation is that Belgian industry has an unusually high preponderance of producers of intermediate goods -- such as glass, chemicals, construction materials, and metal wiring -- which feel the effects of shifts in the economy well before finished-goods makers do. When an automobile manufacturer, for example, believes it's going to have a slow quarter, it reduces its orders for glass and metal -- hurting the sales of the producers of those goods before their own sales begin to sink. The opposite holds true when the car maker expects a rebound.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using ﬁrm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes ﬁrms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

	abstract = {Public opinion surveys have become progressively incorporated into systems of official statistics. Surveys of the economic climate are usually qualitative because they collect opinions of businesspeople and/or experts about the long-term indicators described by a number of variables. In such cases the responses are expressed in ordinal numbers, that is, the respondents verbally report, for example, whether during a given trimester the sales or the new orders have increased, decreased or remained the same as in the previous trimester. These data allow to calculate the percent of respondents in the total population (results are extrapolated), who select every one of the three options. Data are often presented in the form of an index calculated as the difference between the percent of those who claim that a given variable has improved in value and of those who claim that it has deteriorated. As in any survey conducted on a sample the question of the measurement of the sample error of the results has to be addressed, since the error influences both the reliability of the results and the calculation of the sample size adequate for a desired confidence interval. The results presented here are based on data from the Survey of the Business Climate (Encuesta de Clima Empresarial) developed through the collaboration of the Statistical Institute of Catalonia (Institut d’Estadística de Catalunya) with the Chambers of Commerce (Cámaras de Comercio) of Sabadell and Terrassa.},

This paper proposes an alternative EWS, based on a Markov-switching model, which identiﬁes and characterizes crisis periods endogenously; this also allows the model to utilize information contained in exchange rate dynamics. The model is estimated on data from 1972–1999 for the Asian crisis countries, taking a country-by-country approach. The model outperforms standard EWSs, both in signaling crises and reducing false alarms. Two lessons emerge. First, accounting for the dynamics of exchange rates is important. Second, diﬀerent indicators matter for diﬀerent countries, suggesting that the assumption of parameter constancy underlying panel estimates of EWSs may contribute to poor performance.},

In this article, we make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.},

In this case, using the sample ratio, we can often gather valuable information on the variable of interest for the unsampled observations. In many other studies, the ratio itself is of interest, for example when estimating proportions from a random number of observations. In this note we compare three conﬁdence intervals for the population ratio: A large sample interval, a log based version of the large sample interval, and Fieller’s interval. This is done through data analysis and through a small simulation experiment. The Fieller method has often been proposed as a superior interval for small sample sizes. We show through a data example and simulation experiments that Fieller’s method often gives nonsensical and uninformative intervals when the observations are noisy relative to the mean of the data. The large sample interval does not similarly suffer and thus can be a more reliable method for small and large samples.},

But surveys are commonly affected by nonresponding units, which can cause biased results. Many papers have examined the effect of nonresponse in individual or household surveys, but less is known in the case of business surveys. For this reason, we analyse and impute the missing observations in the Ifo Business Survey, a large business survey in Germany. The most prominent result of this survey is the Ifo Business Climate Index, a leading indicator for the German business cycle. To reﬂect the underlying latent data generating process, we compare different imputation approaches for longitudinal data. After this, the microdata are aggregated and the results are compared with the original indicators to evaluate their implications at the macro level. Finally, we show that the differences between the original and imputed indicators do not lead to substantial changes in the interpretation and the forecasting performance of the indicators.},

Labor market recoveries have long been thought of as lagging recoveries in broad economic activity. In particular, the unemployment rate peaks several months after ofﬁcial business cycle troughs and the average duration of unemployment lags further behind. Using estimates from Markov switching models of the unemployment rate, average duration of unemployment, jobless claims, and the exhaustion rate of regular unemployment insurance, this paper dates contractionary and expansionary phases of various aspects of the labor market and their relationship to the ofﬁcial phases of the business cycle. Evidence from these models suggests that inﬂows into unemployment recover almost contemporaneously with broad economic activity, while outﬂows recover almost a year after the end of ofﬁcial recessions. The differential timing in the recoveries of unemployment inﬂows and outﬂows, which is not a characteristic of most macro models of the labor market, accounts for the observed pattern between the unemployment rate and average duration of unemployment. Finally, when comparing the phases of the labor market to periods where Congress extends unemployment insurance beneﬁts, it appears that policymakers target periods where the job ﬁnding rate is low, rather than periods where the stock of unemployed workers is high.},

Although the traditional measures of predictive power for regression models (r 2, root mean square error) have well-defined statistical meanings, they do not necessarily provide an intuitive measure of the predictive utility of regression equations. It is proposed that an index of predictive power can be developed on the basis of the degree of categorical resolution a regression model can achieve. This index of resolution power is shown to increase nonlinearly with the familiar r2 statistic, even under different distributional assumptions. This relationship also shows that the predictive power of models with r2 ≤ 0.65 is low and nearly constant but increases very rapidly for higher r 2 values, thereby justifying the search for additional explanatory variables even in models already explaining a large fraction of the variation.},

	abstract = {Design-based estimators for two-stage simple random sampling with regression can have a lack of precision (efﬁciency) when the primary sampling units (PSUs) vary in size, and PSU totals are approximately proportional to the size of a PSU. Precision and efﬁciency may deteriorate further for domain-speciﬁc estimators when PSUs contain elements from different domains. Design model-unbiased ratio-to-size estimators have been proposed as more efﬁcient. This study introduces a variance estimator for a design model-unbiased ratio estimator. The estimator of variance is derived from a single-stage estimator of a variance of a ratio under two assumptions: the target variable (y) is equal to the sum of a model prediction and two error terms capturing residual errors and model estimation errors; and the existence of an unbiased estimator of model parameters. Extensive simulations conﬁrmed the negative effects of unequal PSU sizes on the precision of the model-assisted estimators of variance and a superior performance of the proposed estimator of variance. These results were conﬁrmed in the analysis of a regional two-stage survey of forest biomass. The proposed variance estimator was generally more efﬁcient than an existing alternative and more stable across a large suite of design settings.},

We focus on the application of mixed Markov models to intensive longitudinal data sets in psychology, which are becoming ever more common and provide a rich description of each subject’s process. We examine how specifications of a Markov model change when continuous random effect distributions are included, and how mixed Markov models can be used in the intensive longitudinal research context.

We start with the ‘classical’ approach proposed in Burns and Mitchell (1946) of dating and analyzing the business cycle. The stylized facts retrieved are commented and compared to those obtained by Harding and Pagan (2002) for the U.S.. Two conclusions can be extracted from the results: a) though the turning points obtained for individual countries seem to cluster and would suggest the idea of a common cycle, there are relevant differences in the stylized facts characterizing the business cycle in the individual European economies under analysis; b) moreover, we ﬁnd relevant differences in the business cycle stylized facts of the European countries and the U.S., mostly in terms of the duration, the amplitude of the cycle and the shape of the recovery. We then adopt the ‘modern’ alternative: the Markov-switching vector autoregression (MS-VAR). The model’s regime probabilities provide an optimal statistical inference of the turning point of the European business cycle. For assessing the capacity of the parametric approach to generate the stylized facts of the classical cycle in Europe, the stylized facts of the original data are compared to those of simulated data. Contrary to the results reported by Harding and Pagan (2002) , we show that the MS-VAR model is a good candidate to be used as an statistical instrument to improve the understanding of the business cycle.},

In time series analysis, the mixture components relate to diﬀerent persistent states characterizing the state-speciﬁc time series process. Model speciﬁcation is discussed in a general form. Emphasis is put on the functional form and the parametrization of timeinvariant and time-varying speciﬁcations of the state transition distribution. The concept of mean-square stability is introduced to discuss the condition under which Markov switching processes have ﬁnite ﬁrst and second moments in the indeﬁnite future. Not surprisingly, a time series process may be mean-square stable even if it switches between bounded and unbounded state-speciﬁc processes. Surprisingly, switching between stable state-speciﬁc processes is neither necessary nor suﬃcient to obtain a mean-square stable time series process. Model estimation proceeds by data augmentation. We derive the basic forward-ﬁltering backward-smoothing/sampling algorithm to infer on the latent state indicator in maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation procedures. Emphasis is again laid on the state transition distribution. We discuss the speciﬁcation of state-invariant prior parameter distributions and posterior parameter inference under either a logit or probit functional form of the state transition distribution. With simulated data, we show that the estimation of parameters under a probit functional form is more eﬃcient. However, a probit functional form renders estimation extremely slow if more than two states drive the time series process. Finally, various applications illustrate how to obtain informative switching in Markov switching models with time-invariant and time-varying transition distributions.},

The main methodological innovation of the CISS is the application of basic portfolio theory to the aggregation of five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual financial stress measures. The aggregation accordingly takes into account the time-varying cross-correlations between the subindices. As a result, the CISS puts relatively more weight on situations in which stress prevails in several market segments at the same time, capturing the idea that financial stress is more systemic and thus more dangerous for the economy as a whole if financial instability spreads more widely across the whole financial system. Applied to euro area data, we determine within a threshold VAR model a systemic crisis-level of the CISS at which financial stress tends to depress real economic activity.},

In a real-time exercise the model detects recessions timely.

	abstract = {Does participating in a longitudinal survey affect respondents’ answers to subsequent questions about their labor force characteristics? In this article, we investigate the magnitude of panel conditioning or time-in-survey biases for key labor force questions in the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). Using linked CPS records for household heads first interviewed between January 2007 and June 2010, our analyses are based on strategic within-person comparisons across survey months and between-person comparisons across CPS rotation groups. We find considerable evidence for panel conditioning effects in the CPS. Panel conditioning downwardly biases the CPS-based unemployment rate, mainly by leading people to remove themselves from its denominator. Across surveys, CPS respondents (claim to) leave the labor force in greater numbers than otherwise equivalent respondents who are participating in the CPS for the first time. The results cannot be attributed to panel attrition or mode effects. We discuss implications for CPS-based research and policy as well as for survey methodology more broadly.},

	abstract = {This paper studies asset allocation decisions in the presence of regime switching in asset returns. We ﬁnd evidence that four separate regimes – characterized as crash, slow growth, bull and recovery states – are required to capture the joint distribution of stock and bond returns. Optimal asset allocations vary considerably across these states and change over time as investors revise their estimates of the state probabilities. In the crash state, buy-and-hold investors allocate more of their portfolio to stocks the longer their investment horizon, while the optimal allocation to stocks declines as a function of the investment horizon in bull markets. The joint effects of learning about state probabilities and predictability of asset returns from the dividend yield give rise to a non-monotonic relationship between the investment horizon and the demand for stocks. Out-of-sample forecasting experiments conﬁrm the economic importance of accounting for the presence of regimes in asset returns. r 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In fact, the volatility structure of this model depends on a ﬁrst exogenous Markov chain whereas the drift structure depends on a conditional Markov chain with respect to the ﬁrst one. The structure is also assumed to be Markovian and both structure and regime are unobserved. Regarding this construction, we extend the classical ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm to be applied to our regime switching model. We apply it to economic datas (Euro-Dollars foreign exchange rate and Brent oil price) to show that this modelling well identiﬁes both mean reverting and volatility regimes switches. Moreover, it allows us to give economic interpretations of this regime classiﬁcation such as some ﬁnancial crisis or some economic policies.},

By including inter-market traders whose trading decision is based on fundamental value of foreign market, the two-market model has a better capability in explaining both markets with domestic fundamental traders turning to be signiﬁcant. The existence of inter-market traders implies that the two markets impact each other through their fundamentals and hence share some common set of factors, which provides foundation of market interactions, such as market co-movement.},

It then discusses the ability of such indicators to predict business cycles and their importance with respect to other standard national accounts data. The results of bivariate analysis show that, whereas the degrees of plant utilization, conﬁdence climate and order book level are procyclical, inventories appear to be countercyclical with respect to both the industrial sector and the whole-economy business cycle. Spectral analysis suggests that the high-frequency elements of the survey data tend to lead those of the business-cycle estimates obtained from the national income accounts. The choice of ﬁltering technique affects the results, especially in the magnitude of co-movements.

The statistical test measures the ability of the model to generalise its predictions to the unseen sessions from the test set. The second method evaluates the model ability to predict the last page of a navigation session based on the preceding pages viewed by recording the mean absolute error of the rank of the last occurring page among the predictions provided by the model.

Next, we examine the switching regime in the S\&P 500 volatility for weekly, daily, 10-minute and 1-minute returns. Results show that the volatility switches regimes frequently, and differences between the distributions of the high and low volatility states become more accentuated as the frequency increases.

This research enhances the ﬁrst package MSVARlib 1.1, which has been deeply inspired by the works of Hamilton and Krolzig. Not to mention the extension to a generalized multivariate regression framework, it notably augments the range of models with a possibly unlimited ﬁnite number of Markov states, oﬀers automatic or manual intialization procedures and adds new statistical tests. The ﬁrst part of this article provides the basic theoretical grounds of the related Markov-switching models. Following sections give some illustrations of the programs through univariate and multivariate examples. One is based on a nonlinear reading of the american unemployment rate. A second study is focused on coincident stochastic models of US recessions and slowdowns. The paper concludes on possible extensions and new applications.

	abstract = {This paper analyses multivariate high frequency ﬁnancial data using realised covariation. We provide a new asymptotic distribution theory for standard methods such as regression, correlation analysis and covariance. It will be based on a ﬁxed interval of time (e.g. a day or week), allowing the number of high frequency returns during this period to go to inﬁnity. Our analysis allows us to study how high frequency correlations, regressions and covariances change through time. In particular we provide conﬁdence intervals for each of these quantities.},

	abstract = {Are fluctuations in firms’ profitability risk a major cause of regular business cycles? We study this question within the framework of a heterogeneous-firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with fixed capital adjustment costs. In such a model, surprise increases of risk lead to a wait-and-see policy for investment at the firm level and a decrease in aggregate economic activity. We calibrate the model using German firm-level data with a broader sectoral, size and ownership coverage than comparable U.S. data sets. The use of these data enables us to provide robust lower and upper bound estimates for the size of firm-level risk fluctuations. We find that time-varying firm-level risk on its own is unlikely to be a major quantitative source of regular business cycle fluctuations. When we augment a model with only aggregate productivity shocks by time-varying risk, the risk shocks dampen the high contemporaneous correlations of the productivity-shock-only model, but do not alter the other unconditional business cycle properties.},

	abstract = {This paper provides survey evidence on ﬁrms’ subjective uncertainty about future sales growth from a new representative panel data set of the German manufacturing sector. The main ﬁnding is that uncertainty reﬂects change: ﬁrms report more subjective uncertainty after either high or low growth realizations. In the cross section of ﬁrms, subjective uncertainty diﬀers from statistical measures of uncertainty such as volatility: fast-growing and large ﬁrms report lower subjective uncertainty than fast-shrinking and small ﬁrms, respectively, even if they face shocks of similar size. In contrast, the substantial time variation in ﬁrm-speciﬁc subjective uncertainty resembles that in conditional volatility: both measures of uncertainty are mildly persistent and rise more when growth is temporarily low.},

Empirical results, based on monthly data for the period 2003–2011, show that during periods of ﬁnancial distress bank lending rates to both households and non-ﬁnancial corporations show a reduction of their degree of pass-through from the money market rate. Signiﬁcant sectoral heterogeneities characterise the transmission mechanism of monetary policy impulses, with rates on loans to non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms being more affected by changes in the interbank rate than loans to households, both in times of high volatility and in normal market conditions.},

Also, our results indicate that accounting for parameter uncertainty improves the left-tail predictions, independently of the inclusion of the Markov-switching mechanism.},

We prove that both the Markov transition probability and the conditional probability are identiﬁed from the joint distribution of three consecutive variables given that the cardinality of X is not greater than that of Y. The approach of identiﬁcation provides a novel methodology to estimate the hidden Markov models, and the performance of the proposed estimators is illustrated by a Monte Carlo experiment. We further extend our methodology to the Markov-switching model which generalizes the hidden Markov model, and show that the extended model can be similarly identiﬁed and estimated from the joint distribution of four consecutive variables if the cardinalities of Y and X are equal.},
